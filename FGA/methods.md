# Fraction of Genome Altered (FGA)

## Calculation

Let:

- $L_i$ = length (in base pairs) of the i-th altered genomic segment  
- $G$ = total size of the reference genome considered ($G = 2,881,033,286$)*

Then:

$FGA = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} L_i}{G}$

\* Only autosomal chromosomes (chr1â€“chr22) from the hg19 (GRCh37) reference genome were considered. The total length of the autosomes was determined using chromosome size data from the UCSC Genome Browser ([hg19 chrom.sizes](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/hg19.chrom.sizes)). Sex chromosomes (chrX and chrY) and unplaced contigs were excluded.
