# Fraction of Genome Altered (FGA)

## Calculation

Let:

- $L_i$ = length (in base pairs) of the i-th altered genomic segment  
- $G$ = total size of the reference genome considered

Then:

$FGA = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} L_i}{G}$

The total length of the reference genome was determined using chromosome size data from the UCSC Genome Browser. Only autosomal chromosomes (chr 1–22) were considered; sex chromosomes (chrX and chrY) and unplaced contigs were excluded.

- **WGS (hg19):** [hg19 chrom.sizes](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/hg19.chrom.sizes), giving $G = 2,881,033,286$ bp
- **OGM (hg38):** [hg38 chrom.sizes](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.chrom.sizes), giving $G = 2,875,001,522$ bp

## Data Files

### OGM

- `cnv_calls_exp_annotation_results.txt`: Contains the start and end positions of copy number variant (CNV) calls (those whose CN states differ from baseline). The `fractionalCopyNumber` column contains the scaled and smoothed CN state for a given CNV call.

### WGS

- `.cns`: Segment files generated by Jumble, an in-house developed SV calling script. Each `.cns` file contains genome-wide copy number segmentation results, including chromosome coordinates and copy number values for each segment.

## Variant Filtering

### 1. Chromosomal Scope

- Only autosomal chromosomes (chr1–22) were included in the analysis.

### 2. Variant Size

- Only CNV segments with a minimum size of 50 kbp were considered.

### 3. CNV Confirmation

CNV segments were retained if their log<sub>2</sub> copy number ratio met the following thresholds:

- **Gain:** log<sub>2</sub> ratio ≥ +0.2
- **Loss:** log<sub>2</sub> ratio ≤ –0.2

These thresholds correspond approximately to a fractional copy number of ≥ 2.30 for gains and ≤ 1.74 for losses, assuming a diploid baseline of 2 copies.

#### WGS

Observed log<sub>2</sub> ratios from tumor samples are influenced by the fraction of normal cells in the sample (tumor purity). To estimate the tumor-specific log<sub>2</sub> ratio, the following formulas were applied:

##### 1. Convert observed log<sub>2</sub> ratio to absolute copy number

$$
CN_{obs} = CN_{normal} \cdot 2^{\text{log2}_{obs}}
$$

Where:  

- $CN_{normal} = 2$ (diploid reference)  
- $\text{log2}_{obs}$ = observed log<sub>2</sub> ratio  

##### 2. Adjust for tumor purity $p$

$$
CN_{tumor} = \frac{ CN_{obs} - CN_{normal} \cdot (1 - p) }{ p }
$$

- For numerical stability, values were clipped to a minimum of 0.01 to avoid negative copy numbers.

##### 3. Convert back to log<sub>2</sub> ratio (tumor-specific)

$$
\text{log2}_{corrected} = \log_2 \left( \frac{ CN_{tumor} }{ CN_{normal} } \right)
$$
